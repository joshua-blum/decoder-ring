# decoder-ring
 This project is an exercise produceed by Thinkful to emulate different kinds of cyphers, and how to encode and decode them.
 The project consists of the following JavaScript functions:
## caesar.js
This function allows the user to encode and decode using the Caesar shift cypher. The Caesar shift "shifts" the alphabet by a certain consistent increment in order to encode a message, and the decoder ring can allow for such messages to be encoded or decoded, provided that the user inputs a "shift number" to indicate the amount by which the letters of the message are shifted.
## polybius.js
This function allows the user to encode and decode using a polybius square styled cypher. The cypher represents all letters as a two-number coordinate.
## substitution.js
This function allows the user to encode and decode using a substitution cypher with an alternative alphabet. The user may encode or decode a message provided that the user inputs the substitution alphabet.
